stuff, a collection of stuff for slack integration

Currently there is only event, a /event command integration that can be used
to keep track of events in slack channels.

Uses CGI script "event" (with optional FastCGI integration) to handle incoming
slack command integrations. Needs SQLite.

Uses optional sender daemon to send messages back to channels using slack
webhook integration. Needs cURL.
